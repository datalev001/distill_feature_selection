# Distill-to-Select: A Teacher–Student Framework for Feature Selection and Interpretable Modeling
A Novel Approach to Enhancing Transparency by Distilling Complex Predictors into Sparse, Human-Readable Models
Traditional models like XGBoost or LightGBM are great at making accurate predictions - but they can feel like black boxes. These models often use dozens (or even hundreds) of features, many of which are highly correlated. Sure, you can look at their "feature importance" rankings, but those can be misleading. For instance, two similar features might both rank high, even though only one is truly essential. And in logistic regression, using standardized coefficients can help a bit, but it still doesn't solve the problem when features are correlated or noisy.
That's where our idea comes in.
Inspired by model distillation techniques in large language models, we introduce a simple but powerful approach: train a strong teacher model (like XGBoost) to do the hard work, then distill its knowledge into a lightweight student model - specifically, a sparse logistic regression. Think of it like learning from a wise professor: the professor knows everything in detail, but the student writes a clean summary using only the most important points.
Our initial experiments show that this distilled model performs almost as well as the full teacher model, while giving you something much easier to understand and explain. Plus, it automatically highlights the most important features - no need to rely on noisy importance rankings or hope that standardized coefficients tell the full story.
This teacher–student setup opens the door for even more flexibility. You can tweak the loss weights, try different types of teacher models, or even adapt it to other types of student models. Overall, it's a fresh and practical way to blend power and simplicity in predictive modeling.
